# Responsive Website Tasty Food 🍕
The project I clone from [Bedimcode](https://www.youtube.com/c/Bedimcode) and website template: [Responsive Tasty Food](https://youtu.be/5RIFrZEjURA)

- Responsive Plants Website Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Contains animations when scrolling.

- Developed first with the Mobile First methodology, then for desktop.

Nice design of a responsive restaurant website 🥗 . It contains a header, home, about, services, menu, app, contact and a footer. It also has a fully developed light/dark mode 🌓 first for mobile then for desktop.
